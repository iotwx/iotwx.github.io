      <description>Inspired by the 3D-PAWS project this project sets out to build upon the wonderful work already done in innovative low-cost weather sensing, to expand it into an open source IoT project.
There is a tremendous amount of energy and innovation around automated weather stations, and now that 3D-printers and low-cost computers (e.g. Raspberry Pi, etc.) have come into popularity, there has been an explosion of experimental systems and software to control and take advantage of these technological tools to do amazing things with weather sensing.</description>
